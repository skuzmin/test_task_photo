INSTALLATION

To install and run the test task you need to have installed NODE(LTS).

1) go to folder app
2) run npm install
3) run npm start
4) go to localhost:4200 (if this port is free)

NOTES

- There was no requirement for display size, so the app was implemented with simple resizing (no mobile or table view but you can resize). Tested on Chrome DevTools emulator, iPhone 7
- Implemented navigation by using TAB key
- If you can't see loading spinner, then you have very good ISP :) so I recommend to add throttling in Chrome Dev Tools (Slow 3G mode)
